// Water chemistry and nitrogen cycle simulation
// This file will contain calculations for:
// - Nitrogen cycle progression (ammonia -> nitrite -> nitrate)
// - pH fluctuations based on biological processes
// - Temperature changes and their effects on system biology
// - Oxygen level changes based on fish load and aeration
// - Water quality degradation and maintenance requirements

// TODO: Implement water cycle simulation logic
