// Fish behavior simulation - growth, health, waste production
// This file will contain complex calculations for:
// - Fish growth over time based on food and water quality
// - Health changes due to overcrowding, poor water, disease
// - Ammonia production rates based on fish size and feeding
// - Breeding mechanics and population dynamics
// - Individual fish AI behavior patterns

// TODO: Implement fish simulation logic
