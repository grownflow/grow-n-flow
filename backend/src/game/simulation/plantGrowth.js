// Plant growth and health simulation
// This file will contain calculations for:
// - Plant growth rates based on nutrients, light, pH
// - Disease and pest mechanics affecting plant health
// - Yield calculations for different plant types and growth stages
// - Nutrient uptake rates affecting water chemistry
// - Seasonal growth patterns and optimal planting times

// TODO: Implement plant growth simulation logic
